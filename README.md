# Investment-Portfolio by Matias Levy-Hara
Keep track of all your Investments with this handy GUI tool!

You can save your investment portfolio and open it up again using the same save file.
To be able to run the program, make sure you enter a name of an existing file (even if it's empty) as a command line argument.
There is a sample input file provided to see how the program works.

To run this program:
	$ java -jar "Investment Portfolio.jar" input.txt
